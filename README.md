### Variables

Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime.

1. Variable stores a single data value that can be changed later.
2. Variables can be defined using var, const & let keyword. Variables defined without var keyword become global variables.
3. Variables must be initialized before using.
4. Multiple variables can be defined in a single line. e.g. var one = 1, two = 2, three = "three";
5. Variables in JavaScript are loosely-typed variables. It can store value of any data type through out it's life time.
